# GitHub README

This repository contains a code snippet that demonstrates how to create a figure with two subplots using Plotly in Python. The code generates random data for the subplots and plots the sine and cosine functions.

## Prerequisites

To run the code, you need to have the following libraries installed:

- Plotly
- Numpy

You can install these libraries using pip:

```shell
pip install plotly numpy
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```shell
   cd your-repository
   ```

3. Open the code file (`main.py`) in your preferred Python IDE or text editor.

4. Run the code.

   ```shell
   python main.py
   ```

   This will generate a figure with two subplots showing the sine and cosine functions.
